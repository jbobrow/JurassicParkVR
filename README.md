# JurassicParkVR
In 1993, Jurassic Park demoed the future, including a Virtual Reality DNA Explorer. Now that DNA Explorer is a reality.

🧬

## Instructions
To run the DNA viewer locally, you will need to do the following:
1. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) & [vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
2. open terminal (or your CLI of choice) and `cd` to this folder
3. type `npm install` – this will install the javascript dependencies
4. type `npx vite` – this will locally serve our DNA Explorer
